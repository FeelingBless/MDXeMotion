Code for testing - run these using Processing 2.x (not tested with 3.x)
The user interfaces for these tests are not documented, see Michael for advice on using these.

PlatformSim emulates a stewart platform. Messages received from the Middleware are used to orient a 3D visualization of a normal or inverted stewart platorm.
The inverted platform uses the configuration of the chair, the normal platform is based on Michael's servo stewart platform.
